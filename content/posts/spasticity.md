title: Spasticity
category: Hemiplegia

This post is an important one as far as [Hemiplegia](/tag/hemiplegia) goes, it forms the foundation of a lot of the other things that I would like to talk about.

Spasticity is one of the most significant symptoms of Hemplegia, it's the source of the majority of my musculoskeletal issues and also the most visible aspect of my *disability*.

> "Spasticity is a feature of altered skeletal muscle performance in muscle tone involving **hypertonia**; it is also referred to as an unusual "tightness", stiffness, and/or "pull" of muscles."

> "Hypertonia is a condition marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and a reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. It is caused by lesions to upper motor neurons in the central nervous system, which carry information from the central nervous system to the muscles and control posture, muscle tone, and reflexes." - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity)

As I mentioned in my [last post](/2016/10/17/what-is-hemiplegia), there were complications during my birth which resulted in me being deprived of oxygen, this in turn damaged the motor region of the cerebral cortex on the left hand side of my brain, and since brains work in reverse, that's how I ended up with right side hemiplegia.

Due to this damage my brain doesn't do a very good job of communicating what it wants the right hand side of my body to do, which results in it keeping the majority of my muscles tense when it tells them to relax. This in itself wouldn't be too bad if there were a way to consciously relax the muscles like I can with my unaffected side, but sadly that's not the case, it is very difficult to get them relaxed. 

Exercise and stretching help, but it gets complicated quite quickly, if you do too much it tires the muscles out and makes them tense, if you do it regularly then miss a day it makes them tense, if you don't do it enough and then do some it makes them tense. I've come to the conclusion that consistent exercise every day for the rest of my life is the only real solution, but sadly not all that easy to achieve!

Over the years I've self medicated using numerous substances, over the past few years the drug of choice has been alcohol, which whilst it helped the muscles relax I neglected the most important fact, that one of the side-effects of alcohol consumption is that it stops the body being able to produce growth hormones which keep muscles strong, in turn making things worse!

I've made numerous attempts at finding the best way to control my spasticity over the years, the most successful so far has been keeping myself active, staying relaxed and building up some strength by lifting weights.

If only it was that easy!
