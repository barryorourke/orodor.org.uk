Once again I find the urge to write, the need to share my experiences as an adult with Cerebral Palsy with an internet almost void of such subject matter.

My first serious attempt at blogging about Cerebral Palsy was back in 2012. As I suspected back then premature ageing would be my enemy, and my failure to listen to my own advice has left me a lot weaker, less mobile and suffering mild chronic pain. I feel I'm now at the point where if I don't get my shit together all the things are going to start to decline very quickly.

I aim to get myself back into shape, get myself as strong as I was back in my late twenties, and slow down the premature ageing process as much as possible.  

Sadly, I'm quite the procrastinator, which is why I'm going to use this blog to keep myself accountable. I would also like to journal my experiences to help other adults with Cerebral Palsy.

In addition to posting about Cerebral Palsy, I may sneak in the odd off-topic post, on other things that interest me!
